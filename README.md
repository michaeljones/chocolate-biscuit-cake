175g (6oz) Kerrygold Pure Irish Butter
2 tbsp Golden Syrup
250g (8.8oz) Dark Chocolate (55-79% cocoa solids cut into pieces)
280g (10oz) Rich Tea Biscuits
85g (3oz) Raisins
85g (3oz) Chopped Roasted Hazelnuts


DIRECTIONS:

Lightly grease a 23cm (9in) cake tin.

Melt the butter, golden syrup and chocolate in the microwave or in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over a very low heat, and then stir until smooth.

Crush the biscuits with a rolling pin, but leave some slightly larger chunks, and tip into the melted chocolate mixture with the raisins and hazelnuts.

Stir well.

Spoon the chocolate mixture into the prepared tin, pressing it down well to get a smooth even surface.

When cool, chill in the fridge, then cut into squares.
